### Problem

How many vowels are in a text? This is our problem, but the main goal is
learn how to use threads in ruby, so, we need to design a solution to find
the number of words in a very long text in two ways

1. Sequential
2. Threads


Plase use the file "text.txt" for your solution, copy it in your solution
folder.


### Output

You must write the vowels count and for performance purpose, please add
the execution time.

    Sequential Search
    {"a"=>4049408, "e"=>6050373, "i"=>3550018, "o"=>4236236, "u"=>1487946}
    run in 19.486149 seconds
    Parallel Search
    {"a"=>4049408, "e"=>6050373, "i"=>3550018, "o"=>4236236, "u"=>1487946}
    run in 11.334201 seconds
### How to run it

Just type ruby vocales2.rb

### Output
Se encontraron las siguientes vocales {"i"=>3176342, "u"=>1487946, "o"=>4222648, "a"=>3920318, "e"=>6043579, "I"=>373676, "A"=>129090, "O"=>13588, "E"=>6794}en un tiempo de464.416423264
