### Problem

How many vowels are in a text? This is our problem, but the main goal is
learn how to use threads in ruby, so, we need to design a solution to find
the number of words in a very long text in two ways

1. Sequential
2. Threads


Plase use the file "text.txt" for your solution, copy it in your solution
folder.


### Output

You must write the vowels count and for performance porpouse, please add
the execution time.

Run with:

    ruby sequential_vowels.rb

Output:

    {"i"=>3550018, "u"=>1487946, "o"=>4236236, "a"=>4049408, "e"=>6050373}
    run in 13.933200414 secs
    {"i"=>3550018, "u"=>1487946, "o"=>4236236, "a"=>4049408, "e"=>6050373}
    run in 13.956841962 secs
