### Problem

How many vowels are in a text? This is our problem, but the main goal is
learn how to use threads in ruby, so, we need to design a solution to find
the number of words in a very long text in two ways

1. Sequential
2. Threads


Plase use the file "text.txt" for your solution, copy it in your solution
folder.

### Running

To run the program just type this command in terminal:

`ruby vowels.rb`


### Output

You must write the vowels count and for performance porpouse, please add
the execution time.

### Sequential

    {"a"=>3920318, "e"=>6043579, "i"=>3176342, "o"=>4222648, "u"=>1487946}
    "Run in 4.224010604 Seconds"

### Threads

    {"a"=>3920318, "e"=>6043579, "i"=>3176342, "o"=>4222648, "u"=>1487946}
