### Problem

How many vowels are in a text? This is our problem, but the main goal is
learn how to use threads in ruby, so, we need to design a solution to find
the number of words in a very long text in two ways

1. Sequential
2. Threads


Plase use the file "text.txt" for your solution, copy it in your solution
folder.

### Running

To run the program just type this command in terminal:

`ruby vowels.rb`


### Output

You must write the vowels count and for performance porpouse, please add
the execution time.

### Sequential

  {"a"=>4409494, "e"=>6410459, "i"=>3910104, "o"=>4596322, "u"=>1848032}
  "Run in 13.120719202 Seconds"


### Threads

    {"a"=>4409494, "e"=>6410459, "i"=>3910104, "o"=>4596322, "u"=>1848032}
