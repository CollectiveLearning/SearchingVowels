### Problem

How many vowels are in a text? This is our problem, but the main goal is
learn how to use threads in ruby, so, we need to design a solution to find
the number of words in a very long text in two ways

1. Sequential
2. Threads


Plase use the file "text.txt" for your solution, copy it in your solution
folder.


### Output

You must write the vowels count and for performance porpouse, please add
the execution time.

{"a"=>7068250, "e"=>10896375, "i"=>5726875, "o"=>7613375, "u"=>2682750}
